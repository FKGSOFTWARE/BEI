MVP Proposal: Bare-Earth Digital Twin Generator
Objective
Create a simplified version of the bare-earth digital twin generator focusing on a small, well-defined area with clear human impact.
Area Selection
Choose a small region (e.g., 5km x 5km) that includes:

Urban development
Some natural terrain
A simple water feature (e.g., a small river or lake)

Data Sources

Use freely available DEM data (e.g., SRTM 30m resolution)
OpenStreetMap data for human-made features

Pipeline Steps

Data Preparation:

Download and process DEM data for the chosen area
Extract relevant features from OpenStreetMap (buildings, roads, etc.)


Simple Masking:

Create a basic algorithm to identify human-made structures based on OSM data
Generate a mask of areas to be "removed" from the landscape


Basic ML Model:

Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., a basic neural network or random forest) to predict elevation in masked areas
Use surrounding non-masked areas as training data


Interpolation:

Apply the trained model to interpolate elevations in masked areas


Visualization:

Create a basic 3D visualization of the original and "bare-earth" versions of the area



Deliverables

Python notebook demonstrating the data processing pipeline
Trained ML model for elevation prediction
Before and after 3D visualizations of the chosen area
Brief report outlining the process, challenges, and potential improvements

Success Criteria

Successfully remove major human-made features from the landscape
Produce a plausible "bare-earth" version of the chosen area
Demonstrate the potential for scaling to larger areas and more complex features
